description: "About page for Lab Time, a technology blog by Jaap de Vos"
---

Lab Time is a project by Jaap de Vos, a network engineer with a few years of experience. He was schooled as a software engineer but soon found that infrastructure technology is more fun. Jaap holds multiple industry certifications including CCNP R&S, VCP-DCV and MCSA. He also has experience in teaching courses about networking and general information technology.

At the moment, Jaap is on a path to build out his framework of networking knowledge. He mainly works in the enterprise space but he's looking to expand his knowledge about data center and service provider technologies too. Regarding certifications, he's just getting started working toward achieving some Juniper SP credentials.

Lab Time is mostly about things you can do in home labs. The blogs are fun and informative. The goals for this blog are sharing knowledge, practicing skills and making name as a network engineer.

The views expressed on Lab Time are my own, I don't express the views of my employer.
