Welcome to Proliferous Technology. My name is Jaap de Vos.

This project started its life under the name Lab Time, which had a focus on anything related to IT home labs. In the new form, Proliferous Technology, the topics include broad IT subjects and some other technical things that I like to explore. The blogs are fun and informative. The goals for this project are sharing knowledge, practicing skills and increasing my visibility.

I am a network engineer with a few years of experience. I was schooled as a software engineer but soon found that infrastructure technology is more fun. I hold multiple industry certifications including CCNP R&S, VCP-DCV and MCSA. I also have experience in teaching courses about networking and general information technology.

At the moment, I'm on a path to build out my framework of networking knowledge. I've mainly worked in the enterprise space but I'm expanding on this by looking into new industries and technical solutions.

The views expressed on Proliferous Technology are my own. I don't represent the views of my employer.
