I'm proud to announce the release of my first two series on Lab Time! The first series is about Eve-NG and it's basically all my content about that topic bundled together. The second series is about my Juniper studies.

<!-- more -->
Doing series on Lab Time has been on my mind since the start of this blog. I'm happy that I can now present the first two series to you. Both of them will be expanded in the future when more content becomes available. I plan do work out a few more topics about Eve-NG and since I'm planning on getting some cool certs from Juniper, the series about my studies for them will definitely see more content too. I want to do additional topics as well. Linux networking, Openstack basics and networking fundamentals are some idea's that I have, but no guarantees about when they will be started yet.
