Somewhere in the following weeks I will be trying to migrate this blog away from WordPress to a static site construction. Right now I have my eyes set on the combination of Hugo and AWS. There are still a lot of details to figure out. This post is basically to announce the change. If you want to keep following me, please keep an eye on my website or my Facebook or Twitter accounts, because the move might break my old RSS feed. More details will follow as my migration progresses.
