This is my list of study material for the Juniper Service Provider certification track. I will keep this list updated in accordance with my own progress and with any good suggestions I might get. Most of the material is focused on the JNCIS-SP and JNCIP-SP exams but some of it continues to be of value up to the JNCIE.

I started by studying for the ENT track but decided to switch to the SP track. I had already finished both the routing and the switching guide for JNCIS-ENT. Luckily, there is a lot of overlap in the exam objectives for [JNCIS-ENT](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/resources/jncis-enterprise/JNCIS-ENT) and [JNCIS-SP](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncissp/), the SP track basically just adds some extra stuff.

##### Official information
  * Juniper informational page about the service provider track:
[https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/sp-routing-switching-track](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/sp-routing-switching-track/)/
  * JNCIS-SP exam (JN0-361) objectives:
[https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncissp/](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncissp/)
  * JNCIP-SP exam (JN0-661) objectives:
[https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncipsp/](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncipsp/)
  * JNCIE-SP exam (JPR-960) objectives:
[https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncie-sp/](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/resources/jncie-sp/)

In the official information, recommendations for studying materials can be found. Note that Juniper also recommends following the official courses, but those are expensive and might not be accessible to most folks. This is a reason for me to not focus too much on the official materials. The courseware from the official courses can be bought separately. The books are still expensive but not as bad as the courses. The courseware library can only be viewed with a valid account. Day One is Junipers library with free resources, but you do need your JNet account to get access. The This Week library is something similar.

##### Lab inspiration
The content of this blog can assist with building your labs, at least if you decide to use a virtual solution. If you decide to go with hardware, I've heard you can come a long way with a couple of EX switches and small SRX'es. The attraction of the SRX is that you can run virtual SRX instances on top of your physical device, allowing you to create a diversity of more complex topologies. I can't comment on how well this solution is suited to the SP track, but for the ENT track, you can study every topic with a setup like this.
For a virtual setup, [this Lab Time post](https://www.lab-time.it/2018/01/09/comparing-juniper-wistar-to-eve-ng/) can serve as a starting point. Furthermore, if you choose to use Eve-NG, check out [the Lab Time series on Eve-NG](https://www.lab-time.it/series-eve-ng/). If you choose to use Wistar, check out [the guide by Robin Gilijamse](https://interestingtraffic.nl/2017/11/16/playing-around-with-wistar/). If you are looking for inspiration for lab topologies, you can consult the following list:

* [BGP toplogies](http://www.networkingwithfish.com/bgp/) by Networking with Fish
* [A L3 MPLS topology](http://noshut.ru/2015/11/basic-l3vpn-bgpmpls-vpn-or-vprn-configuration-alcatel-lucent-juniper/) by noshut.ru. This example mixes devices from multiple vendors, but you can build the same thing with just Junos
