Welcome to the series on Lab Time. I've been wanting to start some series so I can provide more extensive coverage about various topics than makes sense in single posts. The first fruits of my labor are finally here. Future topics might include Linux networking fundamentals and networking fundamentals in general, but I can't say in which particular century I will get them done. For now, the following series will have to suffice.

* [Eve-NG](/series-eve-ng/)  
Eve-NG is a valuable tool to build virtual networking labs. My posts about Eve-NG are now combined in a series. Future Eve-NG posts will also be listed here
