  Hi !

  I have the same installation, except my backup server is also a Proxmox server.
  My VMs are sent from Proxmox source to Proxmox destination via ZnapZend. I see my replicated disks whan I zfs list on the target node but I don’t know how to “import” these VM on target Proxmox node. Do you have an idea ?

  Thanks !
