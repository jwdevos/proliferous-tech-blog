  Hi there ,

  I am using vMX 14. In eve-ng …I am trying to configured logical system with *lt interface , i have check the config twise and it’s okay. I have configured tunnel service , *lt interface shows in vmx.

  But when I assigned *lt interface to logical system it’s not working anymore. Sub *lt interface didn’t shows under respective LS.

  Please suggest any setting when we add vmx node in eve-ng
