  Hi Retno,

  Thanks for your compliments. A spoiler for my next subject: it will be about using Vagrant and on-demand cloud resources to temporarily deploy big labs in a cost-effective way. Iâ€™m working on a new version of my site right now, hoping to release it with one new post before the end of 2018.
