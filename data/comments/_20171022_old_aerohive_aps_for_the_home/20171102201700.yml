  Hi Oscar & soaringsky, thank you for leaving a question. I avoided the political subject in the main post. I am unable to provide specific instructions to obtain recent firmware for the AP’s. Aerohive closes down their download section unless you have active support. I am in the luxurious position of working for a lot of different companies and I also know a lot of people that are doing the same. This makes access to the required files possible. If you need the firmware I would suggest trying to make friendly contact with somebody who would have access. It’s always good to meet technical acquaintances and exchange some knowledge. This is kind of a grey area but I feel that you using second hand AP’s at home does not hurt the business of Aerohive. If anything, your familiarity and good experiences with their products might make you suggest it the next time a project comes around.
