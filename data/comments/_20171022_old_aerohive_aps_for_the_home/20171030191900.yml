  Hey, how did you manage to get a copy of HiveOS 6.5r8a for your second hand APs? Iâ€™ve found that unlike many other vendors Aerohive refuses to support and provide updates for used hardware unless you shell out $$$$$ for a support contract, even if the devices were still under the previous owners contract or are impacted by a big security issue. If you have a link to the 6.5r8a image for AP230 and AP370 could you please share it so I can update my home units?
