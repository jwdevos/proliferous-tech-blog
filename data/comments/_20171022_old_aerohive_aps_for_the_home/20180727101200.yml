  Hello Oscar,

  Thank you for the informative instructions. I bought a few of these APs used off eBay for a NGO that works with deprived children. They needed decent WiFi coverage within their offices but they couldn’t afford anything enterprise. Unfortunately the APs come with an outdated and buggy firmware version (51r1) and I’m having trouble getting the firmware from AeroHive’s support. They basically won’t let me have it unless I provide them the original purchase receipt of the AP from the “Authorised Distributor”!!. On the other hand I don’t know anyone who has access to this brand or its firmware.

  I would be really thankful if you could share some pointers to where I would be able to get a copy of this firmware image, or pass my request to someone who is willing to help, so I could update these units. Thanks in advance
