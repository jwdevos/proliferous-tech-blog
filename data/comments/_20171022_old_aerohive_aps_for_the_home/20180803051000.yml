  Hello Jaap,

  I finally managed to get hold of the latest firmware, flashed the APs and they have been running fine since. I even managed to program them to auto-reboot @ 4:59AM everyday just to keep them APs fresh ðŸ™‚

  The command for reboot scheduling is supported by the 6.5r3+ firmware and it looks like so:

  reboot sched daily every 1 day time 04:59:00

  Save your config and reboot the unit. You can check for remaining time before scheduled reboots using the command: sh reboot sched

  For those who are stuck in a similar situation you can head to https://thehivecommunity.aerohive.com/ and create an account (you might still need a corporate email address) then, using the Topics > Ask A Question menu options, ask for help. I was lucky enough to get a very quick response from one of AH employees who provided me with the required firmware files for my AP.

  Thank you again for the inspiring post and sorry for mixing up names in my previous comment.

  Cheers
