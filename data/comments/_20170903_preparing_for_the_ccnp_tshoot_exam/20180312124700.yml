  Hi, sadly I donâ€™t have the topology anymore. Itâ€™s not a lot of work to put together though, and the exercise of building the topology actually helps with the lab preparation. My L2 software version was mostly i86bi-linux-l2-adventerprisek9-15.2d.bin. For the L3 software it doesnâ€™t matter too much as long as the features you want to use are available in the image you have.  
  
  @Mikhail: you are welcome ðŸ™‚
