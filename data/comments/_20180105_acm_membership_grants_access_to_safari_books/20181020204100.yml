  Hi Mrinal,

  I don’t know which membership option you are referring to specifically. Here is a list of membership options: https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options. The professional membership is one of the cheapest options if you are not a student. I don’t know about Safari access for other membership types, but I’m sure reaching out to ACM will get you your answer.
