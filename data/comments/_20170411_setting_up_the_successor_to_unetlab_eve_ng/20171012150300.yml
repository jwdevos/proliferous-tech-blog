  Hi Aishwarya,

  Thanks for leaving a comment. For support-related questions the forums of Eve-NG are the most active place to ask them: http://eve-ng.net/forum/. Are you running an IOS version like in my examples? I think these kind of problems mostly have to do with your image or the templates and software versions that Eve-NG supports.

  Kind regards,  
  Jaap de Vos
