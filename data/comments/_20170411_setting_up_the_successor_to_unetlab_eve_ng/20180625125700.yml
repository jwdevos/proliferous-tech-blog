  Hi Deepak,

  Thank you for leaving a reply. I have experienced this myself sometimes, usually after a broken update. I had one Eve-NG install go bad because of this, and the only thing I could do was boot an older kernel to get things to work. Are you experiencing this on a fresh install or on an older one? It’s difficult to give help from remote as reachability problems can also be caused by the network environment outside your Eve-NG box. If my experiences don’t give you enough clues to solve this, I suggest asking the question on the Eve-NG support forums to be found on their website.

  Kind regards,  
  Jaap de Vos
