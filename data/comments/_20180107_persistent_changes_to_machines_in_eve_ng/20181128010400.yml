  Hi Jaap,

  Thanks for sharing your experience.  
  In Step 8 we do a “commit” to the linked clone, i.e. hda.qcow2 and then we remove it in Step 9. Aren’t we removing the committed change ?

  Should the commit be done for the /root/junos/jinstall-vmx-14.1R4.8-domestic-modified.qcow2 instead of the linked node.

  Your clarification is much appreciated. Thanks.
